# Tour Booking Management System
A window form application that helps manage tours, trips, booking for a travel company. It allows users to book trips for customers, as well as admin can manage the system.

## Business Background
The Tour Booking system is made to help employees in a travel agency manage their
company's tours, trips and perform tour booking operations for customer needs.
We try to make the system as user-friendly and easy as possible for the users. When
booking a tour, the employee can look up whether the person booking the tour is a former
customer based on the phone number, then if theyâ€™re former customers, the employee can
use their information which has been in the system since the first time they booked,
thereby reducing the time to do customer information procedures.
The system consists of 2 roles, the admin is the person who has all the power, besides, the
employee will be the one to take care of booking for customers.
